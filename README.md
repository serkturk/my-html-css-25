# 🌟 My Portfolio

## 💻 A Challenge I Set for Myself  
I set out to build this portfolio using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The goal was to see how far I could go without relying on JavaScript or frameworks.  

## 🎯 What Happened  
It was a fun and creative challenge, but I soon realized that some **JavaScript** was inevitable for logic and interactivity.  
So yes, there’s JS sprinkled in to keep things running smoothly.  

## 🚀 What’s Next  
This is just the beginning!  
I plan to:  
- Add more **JavaScript** features ✨  
- Upgrade to **React** for a richer, more dynamic experience ⚛️  
- Continue polishing the design so it feels just right 🎨
